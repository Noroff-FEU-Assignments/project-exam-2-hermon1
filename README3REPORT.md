# How to use project 

First clone down the project from github.  

Then open the project and run `npm install` in the terminal.  

Next you can run: 

`npm start` 

This will open a webbrowser and run the application in developer mode locally on your computer. Normally the application starts on `port 3000` if it is not already in use - press `Y` to open on another port. This page will reload when you save any changes. You can also see any errors in the terminal and console.

# What i found challenging 

When i started the project i felt like i had a very good time amount to finish the project but i didnt take into account the real life situations and problems that could occur. Which delayed the process and had me stressing to finish the project. 

I have a tendenciy to overthink how i want the project to be. In this case i wanted something bigger and better than facebook or instagram. But i manged to get my feet down to the ground. 

 When making the gant i always seem to run into the same difficulties. And that is that the project never goes according to the time plan because of problems that take long to solve or bugs ecc.. 

When it comes to the start of the project, i tried to understand the full scope of the project and writting down any ideas that instantly came to mind. I found it difficult to figure out how long the project was goin take me to finish.  

A part of the planning time went into planning out the solution and how it was going to work. Usually at the start of any project gathering information and researching the subject is something i find very benefitial. 

Looking at similar websites/apps has helped me to get an idea of the norms and what users would expect from the site. Having used social media for many years now has been benefitial in giving me an idea of what do's and dont's are, especially in regards to UX and logic. I believe that UX is all about logic and easy flow of tasks with as little confusion as possible for the user. The user should not have to wonder how to do something or what to do next and get good useful feedback back when something is incorrect. 

This is something that can always be improved but i did my best to make this happen. 

I have aimed to have all the required functionality ontop of adding as much extra functionality that was capable of providing considering the time constraints. 

I had some difficulties with responsiveness but bootstrap made it a little easier to create a well responsive and accesible solution.
